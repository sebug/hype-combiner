# Hype Combiner
Using Llama to elaborate API calls with the right arguments and then performing
them.

For this project, I subscribed to https://colab.research.google.com/ with a pro plan to get me an A100.

I will put the APIs in this project, even if they just mirror an existing one (thinking about the TPG transport API and leprogramme.ch, that would be fun anyway because it parses HTML).
